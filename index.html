I first became interested in graphic design in my freshman year of high school. One of my passions is writing, and I used to post my stories on a website called Wattpad. On that site, there's an tool to have a "cover" for your story.
I wanted to create my own covers, so I decided to teach myself how to do digital graphics. At first, I was really really bad, but now, about 5-6 years later, I like to think that I actually have some skill.
As part of the graphics making community, I also got into some html coding. Although, admittedly, my skills are very basic compared to how amazing some people are with html coding.<p><p>
Now that you know the background of how I got into graphic design, here's a chart explaining the different types of graphics I make and their properties:

<div style="color:#ffffff"><p><p>Clearly, I have spent a ton of time teaching myself graphic design. I can honestly say that there have been times that I haven't slept because
I have spent the whole night making graphics. What can I say? The inspiration strikes at the most inopportune times, like 4 a.m. But what makes this
such an addicting hobby for me?
<p><ol><li>I've always liked art, but never had the talent for it.
<ul><li>I have really unsteady hands, which makes painting and drawing really difficult for me.</li>
<li>Despite years of practice, I've never seen much growth in my abilities in other art media.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Mistakes are easy to fix.
<ul><li>If you use the wrong color or adjust the settings badly, all you have to do is hit Ctrl+Z!</li>
<li>You can also go back later and fix any aspects of the artwork that are bothering you.</li>
<li>While this is possible in other forms of art, it is significantly less of a hassle to get it done on a computer than it is to paint over a bad stroke.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>You can do it all at one time!
<ul><li>I'm the type of busy where I go long periods of time without any spare time for myself, but then every once in a while I have hours on end
to waste.</li>
<li>This amount of time doesn't let me get much painting or sketching done, but I can accomplish a lot on Photoshop!</li>
</ul></li>
